# SFML Game Engine

This is a simple game engine built using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) in C++. It provides a basic framework for creating 2D games with support for keyboard and mouse input, text rendering, and basic event handling. The engine is designed to be easy to use and extend, making it a great starting point for small-scale game development projects.

## Features

- Window creation and management
- Basic event handling for keyboard and mouse input
- Text rendering with customizable fonts and colors
- Button functionality for specific actions
- Support for setting the background color of the window
- FPS (Frames Per Second) control for smooth animation
- Logging of errors to both the console and a log file

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following:

- SFML library (version 2.5 or higher)
- C++ compiler with C++11 support

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/berattozgul/GameEngine.git
```
2. Ensure that the SFML library is properly installed and linked.
3. Compile the source files using a C++ compiler that supports C++11.
4. Run the compiled executable.

## Usage

To use the game engine, follow these steps:

1. Initialize an instance of the `Engine` class with the desired window dimensions and title.
2. Customize the game logic, event handling, and rendering as per the requirements of your game.
3. Implement additional features or functionalities based on the provided framework.
4. Run the game and test your implementation.
